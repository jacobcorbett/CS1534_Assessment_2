17/3/24 

- set up basic layout for project, views, public

- added in partials to make all the pages easier to edit all at once

18/3/24

- attempted to connect to database and read data

- used mongoose packge for interacting with mongodb to make it simplier 

- set up a model for the database, just has user and body

- Big change, my inital idea was to use a database and then communicate through there to send and receive messages however after doing some research i found that using a package called 'socket.io' would be the best option and that i can still send all messages to the database as i can then create like a history page or something. so most of today was spent trying to get the socket messages system to work.
